# Reaction User to CSV
This is a prof of concept for a reddit bot request that I keep getting messages for.

## Discord Commands
```
Commands:
rte! <- Prefix

Command: (you must NOT include the "[]" brackets.)

rte!export [message ID] <- replace messageID with the ID of the message you want to export to CSV.
	- This command exports all usernames / user ID that have reacted with the ðŸŽŠ emote.	This emote can be changed in the source on line 77, you will need to rebuild the bot when you do this.
```
